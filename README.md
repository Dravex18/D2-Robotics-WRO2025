Welcome to the official repository of Team D2Robotics, a dedicated group of young engineers working to earn the opportunity to represent Panama at the World Robot Olympiad 2025, which will take place in Singapore. We are currently competing in the Future Engineers category and preparing for the national qualifiers with the goal of securing our spot on the international stage.

This repository contains all the code, documentation, and development resources related to our robot project.

# Team Members

## David Rico

<div align="justify">

David is a thoughtful and strategic member of the team who constantly strives to bring people together and keep the project on track. Passionate about baseball and always aiming to win, he brings a sharp mindset to both teamwork and technical challenges—though anime isn't really his thing.

In the team, David leads the mechanical and electronic design, creating the robot chassis, 3D-printed parts, and custom PCBs. More than just building, he's responsible for planning the overall robot strategy, ensuring all components work together toward a clear goal. He also contributes significantly to project documentation, helping the team stay organized and aligned throughout the competition.
